1. Applying Calibration Files:
   - Bias Frames: These are taken to account for the electronic noise produced by the camera even when no light is reaching the detector.
   Bias frames should always be taken with the same telescope + instrument setup as the observations because the readout noise and camera electronics are specific to that setup. 
   Bias frames can usually be taken anytime during the night, or even the next day, as long as the setup remains the same.
   
   - Dark Frames: Dark frames are used to subtract thermal noise produced by the detector. 
   They need to be taken at the same temperature, exposure time, and setup as the science images. 
   However, they can be taken at any point during the night or even on the next day (with the same conditions) 
   since they don't rely on the sky conditions.
   
   - Flat-Field Frames: These are used to correct for variations in sensitivity across the detector, 
   such as dust on the optics or pixel-to-pixel variation. 
   Flat fields need to be taken with the same telescope, instrument setup, and filter combination as the science observations, 
   as changes in the optical setup would alter the illumination pattern. 
   Ideally, flat fields should be taken close to the time of the observations, 
   but they can be taken later if the setup hasn't changed.
   
   - Arc Lamp (Wavelength Calibration): These are used to determine the wavelength corresponding to each pixel in the spectrograph. 
   The same instrument and telescope setup is crucial for wavelength calibration, 
   as any change in the optical path would shift the wavelength solution. 
   It's best to take these calibrations as close as possible to the science exposures, 
   but they can be taken the next day if the setup remains unchanged.

2. Timing and Reusability of Calibration Exposures:
   - Calibrations must be taken with the same setup: 
   Bias, dark, flat-field, and arc lamp exposures must all be taken with the same telescope and instrument setup as your observations. 
   Any change in the detector or optical path would invalidate these calibration files.
   
   -Calibrations could be taken the next day: 
   In some cases, bias frames, dark frames, and flat fields can be taken on the next day if the setup hasn't changed. 
   However, flat fields are more sensitive to changes in the optical path, so they should ideally be taken on the same night if possible. 
   Arc lamp exposures can also be taken the next day, provided the setup is exactly the same as during the observations.
