In the context of this lab, a dark frame is an image taken with the camera shutter closed, meaning that no light reaches the sensor. It is used to measure the thermal noise and electronic noise that are intrinsic to the camera's CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) or CMOS sensor during an exposure.

Purpose of Dark Frames
Dark frames capture unwanted signals that accumulate on the detector due to:

Thermal Noise: Generated by the random motion of electrons within the detector due to its temperature. The longer the exposure time, the more thermal noise accumulates.
Readout Noise: Introduced by the electronics when reading the signal from the sensor, present even in the absence of light.
Why Dark Frames are Important
Dark frames are subtracted from science images (images taken with the telescope) to correct for this noise. This ensures that the final image represents only the actual light from astronomical objects and not the noise from the camera itself. Subtracting dark frames is critical for improving the quality of the reduced data and for accurate measurement of faint signals.

Constructing Master Darks (Step 1 in Data Reduction)
In your data reduction, you need to construct a master dark frame by taking multiple dark frames of the same exposure time as your science data and then combining them, usually using the median. Here’s why:

Using the Median: The median helps in rejecting cosmic rays (high-energy particles that can create bright pixels) that may appear in individual dark frames but not consistently across all of them.
Matching Exposure Time: The master dark should match the exposure time of your science images because the thermal noise increases with exposure duration. Matching ensures that you subtract the appropriate amount of noise.



A master dark is a combined dark frame created by averaging or taking the median of several individual dark frames. It represents the typical thermal and readout noise that is present in your detector for a given exposure time. Using a master dark allows you to effectively subtract this noise from your science images, improving their quality.

Why Create a Master Dark?
Consistency: A single dark frame can have random noise (like cosmic rays) that might not be present in other dark frames. By combining multiple frames, you can create a master dark that better represents the consistent noise characteristics of the detector.
Cosmic Ray Rejection: Using the median instead of the mean to combine the frames is especially helpful because the median value is less affected by outliers, such as cosmic ray hits, which appear as bright spots in individual dark frames.
Matching Exposure Time: A master dark should match the exposure time of the science images to ensure that the noise pattern is properly subtracted.

The process typically involves the following steps:

Take Multiple Dark Frames: Capture several dark frames with the same exposure time as your science images, keeping the temperature of the CCD constant (to avoid changes in thermal noise).
Read in the Dark Frames: Use a function like read_fits_range to load these dark frames into your program.
Combine Using the Median: Stack the frames and take the median value of each pixel across the stack, creating a single image where each pixel represents the median of that pixel’s value across all the dark frames.
